# Predicting the Quality of Ionosphere-Reflected Pulsed Radar Returns Using a Machine Learning Ensemble Model

Radar is a technology that generates radio signals and captures the reflected signal returns, making it a technology that scientists and researchers can use to study the dynamics and physics of Earthâ€™s upper ionosphere (specifically, E and F regions), including, in particular, its irregularities (Greenwald et al 1985). Machine learning is a feasible approach for predicting the quality of radar ACFs. For this study, an ensemble model was constructed, and then both random forest and the ensemble model were tested with a holdout data set. Random forest performed better than the ensemble model. Pathways of refinement in the future might include exploring more sophisticated methods of constructing ensemble models, and training with a larger data set. Random forest serves as a promising method for the current task of classifying radar returns.
